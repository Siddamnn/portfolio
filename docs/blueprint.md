## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A blend of soothing purples reminiscent of 'La La Land', Lavender (#E6E6FA) meeting deep violet (#9400D3), evocative of a dreamy Hollywood vibe.
- Background color: Desaturated purple, approximately #F0EDF5, appropriate for the light color scheme.
- Accent color: Analogous color in the blue-violet range: #483D8B, which offers greater contrast due to its increased saturation and reduced brightness relative to the other colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' serif, for a literary and vintage feel that suits the 'Poems' content; and because serif fonts are more readable than sans-serif when a larger proportion of the layout involves blocks of text.
- Site icon: The word "Sid's" in neon pink, animated to flicker like a broken lightbulb, giving it a dreamy look.
- Mobile-first responsiveness, code-splitting, and React Router to create a smooth user experience. 
- Use CSS transitions for a flicker-light effect on hover states, with subtle parallax scrolling for depth.
